        <br><strong>Paying for biodiversity or familiarity? Investigating distance decay
        and relative preferences for fish conservation. (under review)</strong>
        <br>Easily recognizable species are often used as so-called ‘flagship’ species
        to raise awareness and funding for conservation action, but this practice has
        been criticized for neglecting low-profile species with important biodiversity
        status. One component of biodiversity is the geographic distribution of where
        species live, with species that live in only one habitat being endemic to that
        particular habitat. This study investigates how respondents to a discrete
        choice experiment ascribe value to the conservation of five different fish
        species with one species being non-endemic to the study area and familiar to
        most respondents while another, much lesser-known species, is endemic to the
        study area. Results show that a substantial fraction of respondents with high
        willingness to pay for conservation has a stronger relative preference for the
        non-familiar species endemic to the study area. While the relative appeal of an
        unfamiliar species with an important biodiversity characteristic is not limited
        by geography, individuals who live relatively close to unfamiliar biodiversity
        may be among those more likely to value such species higher relative to more
        familiar substitute species.

        <strong>At the limit of volunteerism? Swedish family forest owners and policy reform</strong> 
        <br>Sweden has instituted many environmental laws in recent years, but the regulations 
        on what family forest owners can do with their forest properties has changed little 
        in recent decades. This study examines how forest owner opinions of current forest policy
        reveal challenges and opportunities that will need to be addressed in efforts to negotiate 
        and institute policy reforms that impact Swedish family forest owners.
