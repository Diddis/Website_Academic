        <br><strong>Paying for biodiversity or familiarity? Investigating distance decay
        and relative preferences for fish conservation. (under review)</strong>
        <br>Easily recognizable species are often used as so-called ‘flagship’ species
        to raise awareness and funding for conservation action, but this practice has
        been criticized for neglecting low-profile species with important biodiversity
        status. One component of biodiversity is the geographic distribution of where
        species live, with species that live in only one habitat being endemic to that
        particular habitat. This study investigates how respondents to a discrete
        choice experiment ascribe value to the conservation of five different fish
        species with one species being non-endemic to the study area and familiar to
        most respondents while another, much lesser-known species, is endemic to the
        study area. Results show that a substantial fraction of respondents with high
        willingness to pay for conservation has a stronger relative preference for the
        non-familiar species endemic to the study area. While the relative appeal of an
        unfamiliar species with an important biodiversity characteristic is not limited
        by geography, individuals who live relatively close to unfamiliar biodiversity
        may be among those more likely to value such species higher relative to more
        familiar substitute species.

        <br><br><strong>Forest owner objectives typologies: instruments for each owner type or
        instruments for most owner types? (under review)</strong>
        <br>Family forest owners are an increasingly diverse group of individuals with
        differing forest ownership objectives and forest policy instruments should be
        designed with this diversity in mind. One common assumption is that different
        forest owner types (such as profit maximizers, recreation owners, or
        multi-objective owners), will respond to different policy instruments according
        to shared forest ownership objectives. This study creates a standard typology
        of family forest owners in Sweden to see if different owner types have different
        opinions concerning various forest conservation policy instruments. The results
        show some significant but weak relationships between ownership objectives types
        and Sweden’s various forest policy instruments. This study suggests the benefits
        of targeting different kinds of policy instruments to different kinds of ownership
        objectives may be limited. It may be advisable to design any given forest policy
        instrument to be compatible with multiple objectives.
